# Hotel-Manager-App
A hotel manager app consists of different phases, namely, logic implementation, artificial intelligence, and web application development.

This project has almost the same functionalities of an app like booking.com.
People can book flights, hotels, cancel their bookings, and other functionalities akin to its similar applications.
